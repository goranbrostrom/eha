# eha

eha is a package for *event history and survival analysis*, with some
enhancements of the *survival* package and many unique features, like
*sampling of risk sets* and the *weird bootstrap* in Cox regression,
parametric proportional hazards and accelerated failure time models
allowing for right censoring and left truncation. You can read more
about that and other features in the `vignette("eha")`.

## Installation

You can install eha from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("goranbrostrom/eha")
```

If you are on Windows, you need to have
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) installed as
well. Needed for compiling C and Fortran code. It is a good idea (but
not necessary) to install [MikTeX](http://www.miktex.org) so you can get
documentation in PDF format.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
## basic example code
```
