# eha

## Installation

You can install the stable version on
[CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.org/package=eha):

```r
install.packages('eha', dependencies = TRUE)
```

Or you can install the development version from
gitHub:

```r
devtools::install_github("goranbrostrom/eha")
```

You need to install *devtools* first, of course.

If you are on Windows, you need to have
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
installed as well. Needed for compiling C and Fortran code. 
It is a good idea (but not necessary) to install
[MikTeX](http://www.miktex.org)
so you can get .pdf forms of the documentation.
