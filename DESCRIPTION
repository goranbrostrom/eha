Title: Event History Analysis
Description:  Parametric proportional hazards fitting with left truncation and 
        right censoring for common families of distributions, piecewise constant 
        hazards, and discrete models. Parametric accelerated failure time models 
        for left truncated and right censored data. Proportional hazards
        models for tabular and register data. Sampling of risk sets in Cox 
        regression, selections in the Lexis diagram, bootstrapping.
