 *			    C math library
 * function ZEROIN - obtain a function zero within the given range
 *
 * Input
 *	double zeroin(ax,bx,f,info,Tol,Maxit)
 *	double ax;			Root will be seeked for within
 *	double bx;			a range [ax,bx]
 *	double (*f)(double x, void *info); Name of the function whose zero
 *					will be seeked for
 *	void *info;			Add'l info passed to f
 *	double *Tol;			Acceptable tolerance for the root
 *					value.
 *					May be specified as 0.0 to cause
 *					the program to find the root as
 *					accurate as possible
 *
 *	int *Maxit;			Max. iterations
 *
 *
 * Output
 *	Zeroin returns an estimate for the root with accuracy
 *	4 * EPSILON * fabs(x) + tol
 *	*Tol returns estimated precision
 *	*Maxit returns actual # of iterations
 *
 * Algorithm
 *	G.Forsythe, M.Malcolm, C.Moler, Computer methods for mathematical
 *	computations. M., Mir, 1980, p.180 of the Russian edition
 *
 *	The function makes use of the bisection procedure combined with
 *	the linear or quadric inverse interpolation.
 *	At every step program operates on three abscissae - a, b, and c.
 *	b - the last and the best approximation to the root
 *	a - the last but one approximation
 *	c - the last but one or even earlier approximation than a that
 *		1) |f(b)| <= |f(c)|
 *		2) f(b) and f(c) have opposite signs, i.e. b and c confine
 *		   the root
 *	At every step Zeroin selects one of the two new approximations, the
 *	former being obtained by the bisection procedure and the latter
 *	resulting in the interpolation (if a,b, and c are all different
 *	the quadric interpolation is utilized, otherwise the linear one).
 *	If the latter (i.e. obtained by the interpolation) point is
 *	reasonable (i.e. lies within the current interval [b,c] not being
 *	too close to the boundaries) it is accepted. The bisection result
 *	is used in the other case. Therefore, the range of uncertainty is
 *	ensured to be reduced at least by the factor 1.6
