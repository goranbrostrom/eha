	at the time of delivery of their second observed pregnancy. Maternal
	Rh immunization occurs almost exclusively after delivery; however,
	antibodies may not be detectable in the absence of further antigenic
	stimulation.

	The incidence of maternal Rh immunization when maternal-foetal ABO
	incompatibility is also present is 9–13% and 17% for group O and
	non-group O women respectively. This study emphasizes the need to
	offer Rh-immune prophylaxis to Rh-negative women having Rh-positive

  abstract = {The Rh blood group system is one of the most polymorphic and immunogenic
	systems known in humans. In the past decade, intense investigation
	has yielded considerable knowledge of the molecular background of
	this system. The genes encoding 2 distinct Rh proteins that carry
	C or c together with either E or e antigens, and the D antigen, have
	been cloned, and the molecular bases of many of the antigens and
	of the phenotypes have been determined. A related protein, the Rh
	glycoprotein is essential for assembly of the Rh protein complex
	in the erythrocyte membrane and for expression of Rh antigens. The
	purpose of this review is to provide an overview of several aspects
	of the Rh blood group system, including the confusing terminology,
	progress in molecular understanding, and how this developing knowledge
	can be used in the clinical setting. Extensive documentation is provided
	to enable the interested reader to obtain further information. (Blood.

  abstract = {A nation-wide Rh prevention programme was started in Finland in 1969.
	Before that, a control series of approximately 1000 Rh-negative mothers
	giving birth to an Rh-positive child was collected to estimate the
	number of mothers with antibodies at either three, six, or nine months
	post partum. During the three-and-a-half year period altogether 14,980
	Rh-negative patients were given 250 μg of anti-D immunoglobulin
	prepared from Finnish raw material in the Central Laboratory of the
	Dutch Red Cross. Out of those treated before the end of June 1972,
	12,720 (97%) were tested four to six months post partum. Seventeen
	or 0·13% had detectable antibodies; in five of them the infant was
	ABO incompatible. The number of protected mothers with a subsequent
	Rh-positive infant was 1017; 10 had formed antibodies before the
	delivery of the second child.

	The risk of primary immunization initiated during a single pregnancy
	was estimated to be 0·35%. In addition, there was approximately
	a 0·60% risk of forming antibodies by the next Rh-positive pregnancy.

	The effect of prevention on the prevalence of haemolytic disease was
	calculated and compared with observed figures.}

  abstract = {SUMMARY: The RhD protein which is the RHD gene product and a major
	component of the Rh blood group system carries the strongest blood
	group immunogen, the D-antigen. This antigen is absent in a significant
	minority of the human population (RhD-negatives) due to RHD deletion
	or alternation. The origin and persistence of this RhD polymorphism
	is an old evolutionary enigma. Before the advent of modern medicine,
	the carriers of the rarer allele (e.g. RhD-negative women in the
	population of RhD-positives or RhD-positive men in the population
	of RhD-negatives) were at a disadvantage as some of their children
	(RhD-positive children born to pre-immunized RhD-negative mothers)
	were at a higher risk of foetal or newborn death or health impairment
	from haemolytic disease. Therefore, the RhD-polymorphism should be
	unstable, unless the disadvantage of carriers of the locally less
	abundant allele is counterbalanced by, for example, higher viability
	of the heterozygotes. Here we demonstrated for the first time that
	among Toxoplasma-free subjects the RhD-negative men had faster reaction
	times than Rh-positive subjects and showed that heterozygous men
	with both the RhD plus and RhD minus alleles were protected against
	prolongation of reaction times caused by infection with the common
	protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Our results suggest that the
	balancing selection favouring heterozygotes could explain the origin
	and stability of the RhD polymorphism. Moreover, an unequal prevalence
	of toxoplasmosis in different countries could explain pronounced
	differences in frequencies of RhD-negative phenotype in geographically
	distinct populations.},

	be confirmed by the coinciding of the distribution areas of Rh negative
	individuals, Ursus spelaeus and arctus, Ixodes ricinus and Babesia
	divergens. We have also mentioned the possibility that the extinction
	of Neanderthal Man had the same cause as the selection of the Rh
